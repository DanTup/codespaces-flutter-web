# VS Codespaces Flutter Web Sample

A sample repo for trying out Flutter web projects in VS Codespace (formerly VS Online). This is a work in progress, don't expect everything to work.

- Ensure you have the [Dart Debug Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dart-debug-extension/eljbmlghnomdjgdjmbdekegdkbabckhm) if debugging
- [Open this repo in VS Codespaces](https://online.visualstudio.com/environments/new?name=test-flutter-web&repo=DanTup/vsonline-flutter-web)
- If you see a prompt about the Flutter SDK not being found, or not containing a Dart SDK, wait until the script running in the Terminal window completes, and then run the **Reload Window** command from the command palette
- On the debug side bar, click the green play button to debug the app (or choose Run -> Run Without Debugging)
- When the build completes, a new browser window will be opened (check for popup blocking)
- If debugging, the page will load blank - click the Dart Debug Extension icon to connect the debugger and start the app

## Known Issues

- No hot reload??
- No debugging??
- No DevTools??
